# Imperative and Recursive Versions Of Floyd_Warshall Algorithm

## Project Description

This is a python program to find the shortest part between all nodes in a given graph. In this program, we write imperative and recursive versions of the Floyd_warshall algorithm. Using inbuilt Python testing modules such as Unittest and Timeit, unit and preformance tests are carried out and compared.


## Usage

To execute the program, type the following command in your terminal:

    python test_recursive.py
    
To carry out Unit Tests for each of the functions in the functions folder, type the following command in your terminal:

    python -m unittest tests/unit_test_recursive.py

To compare the performance of bothe the recursive and imperative functions, type the following command in your terminal:

    python tests/performance_comparison.py
